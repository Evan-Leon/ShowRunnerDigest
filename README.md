# ShowRunnerDigest
## Background and Overview 
* One of my favorite hobbies (maybe obsession) is watching TV series. I find that the people who create and run these series (generally called Show Runners) do not get enough credit or acknowledgement. I would like ShowRunner Digest to be a place where people can find the people who are responsible for the shows they love and find other shows by the same visionary

* ShowRunner Digest will consolidate avg ratings/episode of various show runners with the option to search for your favorite. As well as see an individual Show Runner along with the average rating of their series. All of this information will be displayed on a 90s era television complete with animations to switch between different graph features

## Functionality and MVPs
* In Showrunner Digest users will be able to:
    * View a graph showing a showrunners show ratings (from high to low)
    * View a comparison of various showrunners and their average episode rating
    * Interact with data when hovered over data bar, will give info on show or showrunner
* This project will include:
    * Animate with tv style animations between graphs
    * A 90s era tv screen which holds all information
    * TV will have interactable buttons to either display data info or change graph metrics
